Welcome to the cheat sheet for `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, and `@testing-library/user-event`! These three libraries are essential tools for testing React components.

- `@testing-library/react` provides utility functions for rendering and interacting with React components in a testing environment. With `@testing-library/react`, you can render components, find elements in the DOM, and make assertions about their content and state.

- `@testing-library/jest-dom` is a library of custom Jest matchers that make it easier to write assertions about the DOM. With `@testing-library/jest-dom`, you can make more powerful and expressive assertions about the elements that you find using `@testing-library/react`.

- `@testing-library/user-event` is a library that provides utility functions for simulating user events in tests. With `@testing-library/user-event`, you can simulate events such as clicks, changes, and keyboard input, which allows you to test the behavior of your components when a user interacts with them.

This cheat sheet will provide you with an overview of the most commonly used functions and features of these three libraries. Whether you are just getting started with testing React components or you are an experienced developer looking for a quick reference, we hope that this cheatsheet will be useful to you!"
